Currently the ruler hashes are only divided by the percentage of the page they take up. Rulers can also be made for specific elements on the page to see how much percentage they take in the container they occupy. Every long mark represents 10%, next in size represents 5%, and the smallest ones representing 1% each.

 If an element is locked, it needs to be unlocked to add a ruler for the element. Then you can lock it again after the rule has been added. Anther example in the following video.
